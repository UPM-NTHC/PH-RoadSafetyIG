## Overview

**PH-RoadSafetyIG** is a national FHIR Implementation Guide for road safety and health information in the Philippines. This project is led by the [UP Manila Standards and Interoperability Lab (SILab)](https://github.com/UP-Manila-SILab/PH-RoadSafetyIG) in partnership with the Department of Health and a broad coalition of government, academic, health, and technology stakeholders.

This guide follows the [WHO SMART Guidelines](https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines) framework for digital health standards. The PH-RoadSafetyIG Implementation Guide (IG) represents the **Level 3 (L3) "Machine Readable"** artifact in the SMART Guidelines process, translating validated workflows and a national Minimum Data Set (MDS) into interoperable HL7 FHIR R4 specifications.

## Project Context

Road-traffic injuries are among the most preventable yet under-reported public health threats in the Philippines. Data is fragmented across paper forms, stand-alone apps, and ad-hoc spreadsheets, creating critical blind spots for policymakers, emergency responders, and families. PH-RoadSafetyIG aims to close these gaps by defining a consensus-driven MDS and mapping it to HL7 FHIR R4 resources, enabling interoperable, machine-readable data exchange nationwide.

This IG is grounded in a series of national co-design workshops and feedback sessions (2025), which brought together over 30 stakeholders from emergency medical services, traffic management, hospitals, local government units, and national agencies. The resulting guide is operationally validated and designed to support both national reporting and local clinical needs.
