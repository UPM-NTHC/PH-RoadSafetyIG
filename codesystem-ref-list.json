      "description" : "The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS) is one of the ICD11 linearizations. Information about the ICD Foundation Component and the ICD11 Linearizations can be found in the complete reference guide here: [https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html](https://icd.who.int/icd11refguide/en/index.html)\r\n\r\n\"**The ICD11 Linearizations (Tabular lists)**\r\n\r\nA linearization is a subset of the foundation component, that is:\r\n\r\n1. fit for a particular purpose: reporting mortality, morbidity, primary care or other uses;\r\n\r\n 2. composed of entities that are Mutually Exclusive of each other; \r\n\r\n3. each entity is given a single parent.\r\n\r\nLinearization is similar to the classical print versions of ICD Tabular List (e.g. volume I of ICD-10 or other previous editions). The main linearization of ICD-11 is Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS). Various linearizations could be built at different granularity, use case or other purposes such as for Primary Care, Clinical Care or Research. The linkage from the foundation component to a particular linearization will ensure consistent use of the ICD.\"\r\n\r\nICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity (ICD-11 MMS) can be downloaded in either print or electronic (spreadsheet) format from the  browser in the Info tab located [here](https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en)",

      "description" : "LOINC provides a set of universal names and ID codes for identifying laboratory and clinical test results.1,2 LOINC facilitates the exchange and pooling of results, such as blood hemoglobin, serum potassium, or vital signs, for clinical care, outcomes management, and research. LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.",
