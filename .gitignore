# The folder 'diagram-sil' is a local symlink to **********\diagram-sil.
# It contains private diagrams and documents by Thomas used for Vibe coding.
# These files are intentionally kept outside the repository and must NOT be committed.
# Keep the symlink/directory ignored so it remains local only.
